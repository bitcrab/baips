# What is a BAIP?

BAIP stands for BitAssets Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an
improvement *consensus*. BitAssets are smartcoins technically owned by
the "committee-account" on the BitShares blockchain. A BAIP is a design document providing information to the BitShares community,
or describing a new feature for BitAssets or change its parameters or price feed
formula, logic and source. In short, this repository is for the community to discuss and organize votings for
things about bitCNY, bitUSD and etc. The BSIP repository will no longer be used for
this purpose unless there is a need to upgrade the BitShares protocol (aka hard fork).

We intend BAIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for
collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions
that have gone into BitAssets. The BAIP author is responsible for building
consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the BAIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

# BAIP Types

There are two kinds of BAIPs:

* An **Informational** BAIP describes a BitAssets design issue, or provides general
  guidelines or information to the BitShares community, but does not propose a
  new feature, consensus change or any other modification. Informational BAIPs do
  not necessarily represent a BitShares community consensus or recommendation,
  so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational BAIPs or follow
  their advice. Examples would be *best-practises* or *recommendations*.
* A **Consensus** Upgrade BAIP describes any change that affects some or all
  BitAssets implementations, such as a parameters or price feed formula, logic and 
  source or addition that affects the applications using BitAssets.

# Contributing

People wishing to submit BAIPs first should propose their idea as github
issue first. After discussion you will be assigned a number for the BAIP
and can send a pull request for your *draft*. Once consensus among
discussion participants is reached, the status can be switched to
*accepted*. From this time on, major changes of the document will not be
permitted.

If the proposal requires BTS holders approval, the proposal is considered
*implemented* only if BTS holders have approved a corresponding worker 
proposal. Two poll worker proposals will be created standing FOR and AGAINST. 
The proposal is considered approved by BTS holders when met these three criterias:
1. FOR worker get more voting power than AGAINST worker. 
2. FOR worker get more voting power than BAIP-Threshold Worker.
3. Both No.1 & 2 above last for three consecutive days.

Once a proposal approved by BTS Holders, new poll worker proposals are required to 
supersede existing approved proposal. 

Informational BAIPs can only reach the *accepted*
state since their implementation is not enforced by the blockchain.

We are fairly liberal with listing BAIP drafts here since the
final decision of its actual implementation is made solely by 
BTS holders via approval voting.

It is highly recommended that a single BAIP contain a single key
proposal or new idea. The more focused the
BAIP, the more successful it tends to be. The BAIP editor reserves the
right to reject BAIP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too
broad. If in doubt, split your BAIP into several well-focused ones.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a BAIP is meant to save
the potential author time. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing
BitAssets that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the BitShares
community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent
on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions
(searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make
sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.
Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for
most people in most areas where BitAssets is used.

Following a discussion, the proposal should be sent to the BitShares Committee
and the BAIP editors with the draft BAIP. This draft must be written in BAIP
style as described below, else it will be sent back without further regard until
proper formatting rules are followed.

If the BAIP editor approves, he will assign the BAIP a number, label it, give it
status "Draft", and add it to the git repository. The BAIP editor will not
unreasonably deny a BAIP. Reasons for denying BAIP status include duplication
of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or
addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the BitShares
philosophy.

The BAIP author may update the Draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates
to drafts may also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

For a BAIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a
clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must
represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be
solid and must not complicate the consensus unduly.

Once a BAIP has been published, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and accepted
by the BTS holders via approval voting, the status will be changed to
"Accepted". A BAIP can also be "Rejected" by BTS holders.

Furthermore, a BAIP can be assigned status "Deferred". The BAIP author or editor
can assign the BAIP this status when no progress is being made on the BAIP. Once
a BAIP is deferred, the BAIP editor can re-assign it to draft status.

BAIPs can also be superseded by a different BAIP, rendering the original
obsolete. This is intended for Informational BAIPs, where version 2 of an API
can replace version 1.

# What belongs in a BAIP?

Each BAIP *should* have the following parts:

* Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the BAIP,
  including the BAIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of
  44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author,
  etc.

* Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being
  addressed.

* Copyright/public domain -- Each BAIP must either be explicitly labelled as
  placed in the public domain (see this BAIP as an example) or licensed under
  the Open Publication License.

* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BAIPs that want to change the
  BitAssets. It should clearly explain why the existing consensus
  specification is inadequate to address the problem that the BAIP solves. BAIP
  submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what
  motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should
  describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the
  feature is supported in other languages. The rationale should provide evidence
  of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns
  raised during discussion.

* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and
  semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to
  allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current
  BitShares platforms.

* Discussion -- The BAIP shall include a discussion on positive and negative
  effects on the BitShares ecosystem shall it be accepted by BTS holders. This
  section is supposed to be the most important section for BTS holders to grasp
  the full impact of the BAIP and help BTS holders to make a decision.

* Summary for BTS holders -- Most BAIPs will probably be of technical nature.
  However, many BTS holders are not as technical as the author of a particular
  BAIP. This non-technical paragraph serves as a place which can be used to
  to interact with BTS holders and help them form their opinion. It is not
  meant to be a marketing driven paragraph to convince BTS holders to vote
  **for** or **against** a proposal, though.

# BAIP Formats and Templates

BAIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown format. Image files should be
included in a subdirectory for that BAIP. A template including the header
preamble is provided in [this repository](BAIPs-Template.md).

# BAIP Editors

The current BAIP editors are:

 * Abit More <https://github.com/abitmore>
 * Jerry Liu <bitcrab@qq.com>

The editors don't pass judgement on BAIPs. We merely do the administrative &
editorial part.

Many BAIPs are written and maintained by Committee with write access to the
BitShares codebase. The BAIP editors monitor BAIP changes, and correct any
structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

For each new BAIP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the BAIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make
  technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Edit the BAIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.),
  markup (for reST BAIPs), code style (examples should match BAIP 8 & 7).

Once the BAIP is ready for the repository it should be submitted as a "pull
request" to the [https://github.com/BitShares/baips] repository
on GitHub where it may get further feedback.

The BAIP editor will:

* Assign a BAIP number (almost always just the next available number, but
  sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141) in the pull request
  comments.
* Merge the pull request when the author is ready (allowing some time for
  further peer review).
* List the BAIP in [[README.mediawiki]]
* Send email back to the BAIP author with next steps (post to BitShares mailing
  list).

# History

This document was derived heavily from Bitshares BSIP-0001, Python's PEP-0001 and Bitcoin BIP-0001.
In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the
BSIP-0001/PEP-0001/BIP-0001 text was written by Fabian Schuh, Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David
Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the BitAsset Improvement
Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to
BitShares or the BAIP process. Please direct all comments to the BAIP editors
or the BitShares development mailing list.
