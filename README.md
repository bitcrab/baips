# BitAssets Improvement Proposal

BAIP stands for BitAssets Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an
improvement *consensus*. BitAssets are smartcoins technically owned by
the "committee-account" on the BitShares blockchain. A BAIP is a design document providing information to the BitShares community,
or describing a new feature for BitAssets or change its parameters or price feed
formula, logic and source. In short, this repository is for the community to discuss and organize votings for
things about bitCNY, bitUSD and etc. The BSIP repository will no longer be used for
this purpose unless there is a need to upgrade the BitShares protocol (aka hard fork).

The distinct document [BAIP Purpose and Guidelines](baip-0001.md) gives a more
detailed explanation.
